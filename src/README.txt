This is an extensible system for animating Java code. 

It is based on Will Hipschman's undegrad thesis.

The examples package contains illustrative examples. 

These show how to animate sorting of a list, creation and manipulation of trees and graphs, and a scanning algorithms.

For now the best way to understand the code structure is use the debugget to step through one or more of these example programs.

Perhaps we will add more later
